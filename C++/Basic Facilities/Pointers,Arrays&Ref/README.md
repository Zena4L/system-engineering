# Introduction
This chapter deals with the basic language mechanisms for referring to memory. Obviously, we can refer to an object by name, but in C++ (most) objects ‘‘have identity.’’ That is, they reside at a specific address in memory, and an object can be accessed if you know its address and its type. The language constructs for holding and using addresses are pointers and references.
